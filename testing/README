To run the Checker program described in the HW8 writeup,
copy the files Checker.class and TrayVerifier.class from this directory
to the directory that contains your Solver program.  Run the Checker program
by sending it the output of your Solver program.  In a command line shell, you can
do that with the following command in the command line:

    java Solver init goal | java Checker init goal
(Init and goal stand for names of files containing the initial and goal 
configurations, respectively.)
